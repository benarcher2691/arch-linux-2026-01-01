# Next Steps

## Tomorrow

- [x] Continue work on Waybar - configure workspaces display, styling
- [x] Try the GitHub dotfiles (stow deployment)
- [x] General smoke tests (bluetooth, audio, brightness, screenshots)
- [x] Nicer startup experience
  - [x] Cleaner boot (quiet kernel params, plymouth splash?)
  - [x] More graphical greetd (regreet)

## Soon

- [x] Fix stow symlink for hypr config (was working correctly - stow uses directory-level symlinks)
- [x] Investigate boot text flicker between greetd and Hyprland (fixed: greetd vt=7, kernel fbcon=vc:2-6)

## Future / Low Priority

- [ ] Raspberry Pi Pico development toolchain
  - picotool, pico-sdk
  - arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain
  - VSCode or Neovim setup for embedded dev
