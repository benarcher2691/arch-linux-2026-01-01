# Next Steps

## Tomorrow

- [x] Continue work on Waybar - configure workspaces display, styling
- [x] Try the GitHub dotfiles (stow deployment)
- [ ] General smoke tests (bluetooth, audio, brightness, screenshots)
- [x] Nicer startup experience
  - [x] Cleaner boot (quiet kernel params, plymouth splash?)
  - [x] More graphical greetd (regreet)

## Soon

- [ ] Fix stow symlink for hypr config (`cd ~/dotfiles && stow -R hypr`)
- [ ] Investigate boot text flicker between greetd and Hyprland

## Future / Low Priority

- [ ] Raspberry Pi Pico development toolchain
  - picotool, pico-sdk
  - arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain
  - VSCode or Neovim setup for embedded dev
